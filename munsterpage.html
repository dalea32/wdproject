        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p id="tenthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The Cliffs of Moher are sea cliffs located at the southwestern edge of the Burren
            region in County Clare, Ireland. They run for about 14 kilometres (9 miles).
            At their southern end, they rise 120 metres (390 ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at
            Hag's Head, and, 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the north, they reach their maximum
            height of 214 metres (702 ft) just north of O'Brien's Tower, a round stone
            tower near the midpoint of the cliffs, built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O'Brien,
            then continue at lower heights. The closest settlements are the villages of
            Liscannor 6 km (4 miles) to the south, and Doolin 7 km (4 miles) to the north.
            From the cliffs, and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands
            in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north
            in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank among
            the most visited tourist sites in Ireland, with around 1.5 million visits per year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffs_of_Moher">For more Information...</a>

        <h3>Things To Do</h3>
        <p id="eleventhParagraph" style="color: green;">
            Explore a magical landscape that seems to change from craggy cliff to 
            soft folds of green in a heartbeat. A coastline dotted with picture-postcard
            cottages is followed by a winding trail from Doolin village to Liscannor.
            The trail will bring you into one of the most outstanding landscapes of 
            Ireland with views over Aill na Searrach, the Aran Islands, and Galway Bay.
            Experience lush landscapes, waterfalls, and Cliffs. The walk is fairly flat
            with only a slight and gradual rise to the higher cliffs. The overall trail
            takes about 6 hours allowing plenty time to stop for photos, breaks and
            taking in the scenery with views to the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, Aill Na
            Searrach and the Atlantic Ocean way below your feet. You can do the entire
            walk or just a section of the walk starting at a number of parking areas
            along the route or from the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Centre itself. <a href="http://www.cliffs-moher.com/Cliffs-Moher-Coastal-walk.php">For More Information...</a>

        <h4>Points of Interest</h4>
        <p id="twelfthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The best way to experience the Cliffs of Moher is to avoid the Cliffs of Moher
            Vistor Experience and explore the Cliff top Trails or cruise along the bottom
            from Doolin. Doolin is a vibrant place full of characters, stories and experiences
            and is home to some of the region's best accommodation, eateries and beautiful
            local shops.The people of Doolin are passionate about their community and look
            forward to welcoming you with open arms. Doolin, once a quiet fishing village
            tucked away on the north-west coast of Clare on the Wild Atlantic Way.
            It has become a veritable mecca for fans of traditional music from all
            over the world and has established for itself an international reputation
            unequalled anywhere on this island. It might be said that Doolin is to
            Irish traditional music what New Orleans is to traditional jazz. Doolin
            is also the start of the Burren, one of the largest and most accessible
            Karst regions in the world. The Burren is the only place on the planet
            that Arctic, Mediterranean and Alpine plants grow side-by-side. It's
            ancient, awe-inspiring stone structures hold secrets from the past
            that may never be unravelled. <a href="http://www.cliffs-moher.com/doolin.php">For More Information...</a>
