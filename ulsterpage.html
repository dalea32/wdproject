        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p id="forthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            Around 50 to 60 million years ago, during the Paleocene Epoch,
            Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity, when highly fluid
            molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive
            volcanic plateau. As the lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal
            contraction fractured in a similar way to drying mud, with the cracks
            propagating down as the mass cooled, leaving pillarlike structures,
            which also fractured horizontally into "biscuits". In many cases,
            the horizontal fracture resulted in a bottom face that is convex,
            while the upper face of the lower segment is concave, producing what
            are called "ball and socket" joints. The size of the columns
            was primarily determined by the speed at which lava cooled. 
            The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns
            seen today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic
            plateau called the Thulean Plateau, which formed during the Paleocene. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway">For More Information...</a>

        <h3>Things To Do</h3>
        <p id="fifthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The area is a haven for seabirds, such as fulmar, petrel, cormorant, shag,
            redshank, guillemot and razorbill, while the weathered rock formations host
            numerous plant types, including sea spleenwort, hare's-foot trefoil, vernal
            squill, sea fescue and frog orchid. A stromatolite colony was reportedly
            found at the Giant's Causeway in October 2011 - an unusual find, as stromatolites
            are more commonly found in warmer waters with higher saline content than that found at the causeway.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway">For More Information...</a>

        <h4>Points of Interest</h4>
        <p id="sixthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            In 2012 the new architecturally designed bespoke Giant's Causeway Visitor centre opened,
            replacing the original building built in 1986 when UNESCO added the Giant's Causeway to
            its coveted list of exceptional interest and universal sites value. The new centre is
            gateway to the famous Giant's Causeway, semi-hidden in the hillside. It offers
            various ways to learn more about myths, legends, social history, wildlife and conservation.
            There are large screens for shows and a shop (selling souvenirs and local crafts),
            and a cafe that supply books, pamphlets, tourist information and multi-lingual audio guides.
            The National Trust runs the Causeway Visitor Centre, so it's free to enter with a National Trust Membership.<a href="https://giantscausewayofficialguide.com/">For More Information...</a>
