        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p id="firstParagraph" style="color: green;">
            Achill Island in County Mayo is the largest of the Irish isles, 
            and is situated off the west coast of Ireland. It has a population 
            of 2,594. Its area is 148 km2 (57 sq mi). Achill is attached to
            the mainland by Michael Davitt Bridge, between the villages of Gob
            an Choire (Achill Sound) and Poll Raithni (Polranny). A bridge was
            first completed here in 1887. Other centres of population include
            the villages of Keel, Dooagh, Dumha Eige (Dooega), Dun Ibhir (Dooniver),
            and Dugort. The parish's main Gaelic football pitch and secondary
            school are on the mainland at Poll Raithni. Early human settlements
            are believed to have been established on Achill around 3000 BC. The
            island is 87% peat bog. The parish of Achill
            consists of Achill Island, Achillbeg, Inishbiggle and the Corraun
            Peninsula. Roughly half of the island, including the villages of Achill Sound
            and Bunacurry are in the Gaeltacht (traditional Irish-speaking region)
            of Ireland, although the vast majority of the island's population
            speaks English as their daily language.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achill_Island"> For More Information...</a>

        <h3>Things To Do</h3>
        <p id="secondParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The cliffs of Croaghaun on the western end of the island are the third
            highest sea cliffs in Europe but are inaccessible by road. Near the
            westernmost point of Achill, Achill Head, is Keem Bay. Keel Beach
            is quite popular with tourists and some locals as a surfing location.
            South of Keem beach is Moytoge Head, which with its rounded appearance
            drops dramatically down to the ocean. An old British observation
            post, built during World War I to prevent the Germans from landing
            arms for the Irish Republican Army, is still standing on Moytoge.
            During the Second World War this post was rebuilt by the Irish
            Defence Forces as a Look Out Post for the Coast Watching Service wing
            of the Defence Forces. It operated from 1939 to 1945.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achill_Island"> For More Information...</a>

        <h4>Points of Interest</h4>
        <p id="thirdParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The mountain of Slievemore, (672 m) rises dramatically in the north of the island
            and the Atlantic Drive (along the south/west of the island) has some dramatic views.
            On the slopes of Slievemore, there is an abandoned village (the "Deserted Village")
            The Deserted Village is traditionally thought to be a remnant village from An Gorta
            Mor (The Great Hunger of 1845-1849). Just west of the deserted village is an old
            Martello tower, again built by the British to warn of any possible French invasion
            during the Napoleonic Wars. The area also boasts an approximately 5000-year-old
            Neolithic tomb. Achillbeg (Acaill Beag, Little Achill) is a small island just
            off Achill's southern tip. Its inhabitants were resettled on Achill in the 1960s.
            A plaque to Johnny Kilbane is situated on Achillbeg and was erected to celebrate
            100 years since his first championship win. The villages of Dooniver and Askill
            have picturesque scenery and the cycle route is popular with tourists. Caislean
            Ghrainne, also known as Kildownet Castle, is a small tower house built in the
            early 1400s. It is located in Cloughmore, on the south of Achill Island. It
            is noted for its associations with Grace O'Malley, along with the larger
            Rockfleet Castle in Newport.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achill_Island"> For More Information...</a>
