        <h2>The History</h2>
        <p id="seventhParagraph" style="color: green;">
            Kilkenny Castle has been an important site since Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke,
            commonly known as Strongbow constructed the first castle, probably a wooden structure,
            in the 12th century. The Anglo-Normans had established a castle in 1173, possibly on
            the site of an earlier residence of the Mac Giolla Phadraig kings of Osraighe. Kilkenny
            formed part of the lordship of Leinster, which was granted to Strongbow. Strongbow's
            daughter and heiress, Isabel married William Marshall in 1189. Marshall owned large
            estates in Ireland, England, Wales and France and managed them effectively. In 1192,
            he appointed Geoffrey FitzRobert as seneschal of Leinster and so began a major phase of development in
            Kilkenny, including the development of Kilkenny Castle. The first stone castle on the site, was
            completed in 1260. This was a square-shaped castle with towers at each corner; three of these
            original four towers survive to this day.The castle was owned by the seneschal of Kilkenny
            Sir Gilbert De Bohun who inherited the county of Kilkenny and castle from his mother
            in 1270, in 1300 he was outlawed by Edward I but was reinstated in 1303, he held the
            castle until his death in 1381. It was not granted to his heir Joan, but seized by the crown
            and sold to the Butler family in 1391. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny_Castle"> For More Information...</a>

        <h3>Things To Do</h3>
        <p id="eigthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            Over the past fifty years the Office of Public Works has infused new life into Kilkenny
            Castle, today visitors can enjoy this grand old country house furnished with the family
            paintings and tapestries and objects d'art. The suite of reception rooms, the Ante Room,
            Drawing Room and Library, with their patterned carpets, yellow silk wall hangings,
            paintings and sumptuous furnishings, recall a bygone age of wealth and splendour.
            The dining room is bedecked with family silver and tableware, the Oriental fashion
            of the nineteenth century can be seen in the Chinese Bedroom and by various exotic
            furnishings found throughout the building. In the Picture Gallery, the stunning
            hand painted roof is decorated with Pre-Raphaelite ladies and naturalistic scenes
            and is significant for its architecture and design. Many portraits of the family
            hang in this room along with the spectacular 17th tapestries of the Decius Mus series. <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/the-collection/">For More Information...</a>

        <h4>Points of Interest</h4>
        <p id="ninthParagraph" style="color: green;">
            The Decius Mus Tapestries are among the great glories of the wonderful historic Ormonde
            Collection at Kilkenny Castle. The 'Decius' suite had been in the ownership of the
            Ormonde family for over 300 years and was displayed in several of their residences
            before being acquired by OPW for display in Kilkenny Castle. The centuries took a
            toll on the delicate fabrics and major conservation was needed. This intricate work
            was entrusted to Real Fabrica de Tapices in Madrid, one of the leading international
            conservation specialists in this medium. After three years of painstaking work the
            Tapestries have returned to their 'rightful home' at Kilkenny Castle and again form
            a highlight of the Ormonde Collection in the Tapestry Room and fabulous Picture
            Gallery - one of the finest historic and architectural spaces in Ireland. <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/tapestries/">For More Information...</a>
